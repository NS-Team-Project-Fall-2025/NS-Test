In Section 8.2, we covered cryptographic techniques for encrypting \nand decrypting data, including symmetric key cryptography and public key cryp-tography. DES and RSA were examined as specific case studies of these two major classes of cryptographic techniques in use in today’s networks.\nIn Section 8.3, we examined two approaches for providing message integ-\nrity: message authentication codes (MACs) and digital signatures. The two approaches have a number of parallels. Both use cryptographic hash functions and both techniques enable us to verify the source of the message as well as the integrity of the message itself. One important difference is that MACs do not rely on encryption whereas digital signatures require a public key infrastruc-ture. Both techniques are extensively used in practice, as we saw in Sections 8.5\n\nDocument 3 (Source: computer-networking-a-top-down-approach-8th-edition.pdf):\nM08_KURO1557_08_SE_C08.indd   610 11/02/20   5:17 PM8.2  •   PRINCIPL ES OF CRYPTO GRAPHY     611\nlong history of cryptography. A complete discussion of cryptography itself requires \na complete book [Bishop 2003; Kaufman 2002; Schneier 2015] and so we only touch on the essential aspects of cryptography, particularly as they are practiced on the Internet. We also note that while our focus in this section will be on the use of cryptography for confidentiality, we’ll see shortly that cryptographic techniques are inextricably woven into authentication, message integrity, nonrepudiation, and more.\nCryptographic techniques allow a sender to disguise data so that an intruder can \ngain no information from the intercepted data. The receiver, of course, must be able to recover the original data from the disguised data.

For example, DES uses 64-bit blocks with a 56-bit key. AES uses 128-bit blocks and can operate with keys that are 128, 192, and 256 bits long. An algorithm’s key determines the specific “mini-table” mappings and permutations within the algorithm’s internals. The brute-force attack for each of these ciphers is to cycle through all the keys, applying the decryption algorithm with each key. Observe that with a key length of n, there are"
