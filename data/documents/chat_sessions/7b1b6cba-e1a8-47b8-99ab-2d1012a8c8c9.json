However, because the calculations involved, both in key  generation\n \nand in  enc\nryption/decryption, are complex, the larger the size of the key, \nthe slower the system will run. SP 800-131A (Transitions: Recommendation for Transitioning the Use of Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Lengths, November 2015) recommends the use of a 2048-bit key size. A recent report from the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (Algorithms, key size and parameters report—2014, November 2014) recom-mends a 3072-bit key length. Either of these lengths should provide adequate security for a considerable time into the future.\n◆■Timing attacks: These depend on the running time of the decryption algo-rithm. Various approaches to mask the time required so as to thwart attempts to deduce key size have been suggested, such as introducing a random delay.\n\nDocument 3 (Source: computer-networking-a-top-down-approach-8th-edition.pdf):\n8.2 Principles of Cryptography\nAlthough cryptography has a long history dating back at least as far as Julius  Caesar, \nmodern cryptographic techniques, including many of those used in the Internet, are based on advances made in the past 30 years.

NIST selected Rijndael as the proposed AES algorithm.

In the description of this section, we assume a key length of 128 bits, which is likely to be the one most commonly implemented.\nThe input to the encryption and decryption algorithms is a single 128-bit \nblock. In FIPS PUB 197, this block is depicted as a square matrix of bytes. This"
